# Terms & Conditions

!!! info "Consent"

    By continuing to use the FreeFlarum service, you agree with the follwing Terms & Conditions. Forums that violate these regulations will be suspended without prior notice.

**1.** Your forum mustn't contain: spam, pornography, or other illegal activities per your valid state regulations and laws, such as, but not limited to: multi-level marketing schemes, warez/pirated/cracked content sharing (eg.: content that is normally paid for but shared for free), sharing personal details of other people without their consent, abusive and/or hate speech, homophobia, racism, etc.

  - FreeFlarum forums are also forbidden to link to external third-party websites & services containing previously mentioned forbidden content.

**2.** FreeFlarum is directed to people who are at least 13 years old.

  - If you are under the age of 13 without having your parent's/legal guardian's consent, per the requirements of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), you can't use the FreeFlarum service.

**3.** The service applies a fair use policy towards resources (storage, server capacity and traffic) of free accounts.

  - The limits are five times the average of all users of the service. Specifically, this means that no more than 250 users per forum are supported.

  - This limit may be surpassed and your forum can function properly, however we do not provide support for forums above the limit because we don't officially support them - if you want to run a busy forum, your best option might be to self-host it instead.

**4.** You are allowed to modify the full appearance of your forum (through the "Administration" panel at your Flarum instance), but it is not allowed to change the appearance as in to hide or otherwise hinder the displayed advertisements of FreeFlarum, such as the FreeFlarum footer. If you would like to remove that footer, please [see this page](./faq/#can-i-pay-to-remove-the-powered-by-freeflarum-footer-for-my-or-other-forum).

**5.** FreeFlarum reserves the right to cancel forums that are detrimental to its quality of service or reputation, at its sole discretion.

**6.** Forums that are not used for more than 3 months (no logins/posts/visitors) may be removed without prior notice. These forums may be reactivated upon a request from the forum's owner.

  - We accept requests to remove forums that might be violating these terms. Please, see [this page](./faq/#can-i-report-a-forum-that-violates-your-terms-conditions-or-is-inappropriate-by-any-other-means) on how to proceed.

**7.** Although generous efforts are undertaken to maintain the availability and performance of this service, there is explicitly no warranty given. Use it at your own risk.

**8.** This service is not available to persons or legal entities who operate legal constructs for the purpose of tax evasion or concealment of the ultimate benefactor, such to be determined by FreeFlarum at its sole discretion.

**9.** You are not allowed to monetize your forum (eg.: by using the "Google Adsense" service, having a "pay-to-see" content and other similar techniques). We are a free, voluentary, community provided service and we are not looking towards to become a commercial entity. Getting profit from something that is provided for free is not a good practice either.

  - If you'd like to monetize your forum, the best option for you right now is to self-host it instead.

**10.** You are required to promptly address any security vulnerabilities at FreeFlarum that you find by [E-mailing us](mailto:info@freeflarum.com).
